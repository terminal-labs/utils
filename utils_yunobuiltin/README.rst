Issues

Open an issue. We should be pretty responsive, as we use this internally all over. We'd love to know about any bugs.

Please let us know the version that you found it on.  If you can, include a failing test.

Please include a test.

Don't break API compatibility. I'll be sad. I'll have to reject your change, then you'll be sad.
Keep the world a happier place and don't break API compatibility.
